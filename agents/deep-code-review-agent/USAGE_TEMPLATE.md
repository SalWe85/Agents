Goal: Deep review target and risk focus:
Mode: Full Review or Re-review
Inputs: task_identifier:
Inputs: Repository root path:
Inputs: Existing report path (required for Re-review): /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/REVIEW_TASKS.md
Inputs: Optional focus modules or risk themes:
Inputs: tracking_mode: linear

Inputs: local_issue_dir: /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/
Inputs: local_state_path: /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/state.yaml
Inputs: local_events_path: /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/events.jsonl
Constraints: Read-only review. No code changes. Resolve `tracking_mode` first and consume latest `REVIEW_TASK` packet. Do not write shared sprint state files; in local mode write only under `/reports/issues/<task_identifier>/`.
Output: /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/REVIEW_TASKS.md with executive summary, top 10 urgent fixes, quick wins, prioritized tasks (P0-P3), needs manual verification, out-of-scope, and verification steps per task. Require unique task IDs and summary references by task ID. Publish structured review outcome event.
