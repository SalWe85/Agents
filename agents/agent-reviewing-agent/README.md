# Agent Reviewing Agent
Last Updated: 2026-02-15 19:18 CET

## Mission
Review candidate agents for quality, completeness, and safety against repository standards.

## In Scope
- Review agent packages under `agents/` (all required files)
- Score agents with the standard 16-point rubric
- Report pass/fail with actionable improvements
- Verify hard gates (timestamp + visible rubric output)

## Out of Scope
- Writing production application code
- Deploying systems
- Security auditing non-agent project infrastructure

## Inputs
- Required:
  - Target agent folder path
  - Standards source: `/agents/agent-making-agent/README.md`
- Optional:
  - User-specific quality priorities (for example, strictness on safety)

## Skills
- Required Skills:
  - None for baseline static review of agent files.
- Potentially Required Skills:
  - `skill-creator`: when reviewing agent + skill bundles together.
  - `linear`: when converting review findings into tracked issues.
- If Missing, Install From:
  - Repo skill definitions: `/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` and `/skills/linear/SKILL.md`
  - Runtime skill locations: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` and `$CODEX_HOME/skills/linear/SKILL.md`
  - User note: copy skill folders from this repo's `/skills/` into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` when needed.
- Fallback Behavior If Skill Is Unavailable:
  - Complete static file review and rubric scoring without external integrations.
  - Flag skipped skill-assisted checks explicitly in the output.
- Restart Note:
  - After installing any missing skill, restart Codex before rerunning this agent.


## MCP (If Needed)
- Required MCP Servers:
  - None for baseline static agent review.
- Potentially Required MCP Servers:
  - `linear`: when review findings are expected to be turned into issues.
- If Missing, Setup From:
  - `/mcp/servers/linear.md`
  - `/mcp/templates/mcp-config.example.toml`
- Fallback Behavior If MCP Is Unavailable:
  - Complete review and rubric scoring locally.
  - Return manual issue creation steps.
- Restart Note:
  - After MCP setup/config changes, restart Codex before rerunning this agent.


## Outputs
- Format:
  - Findings list by severity
  - File completeness status for `README.md`, `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md`, and `EXAMPLES.md`
  - Rubric scores (0-2 each criterion)
  - Total score (`X/16`) and `PASS/FAIL`
  - Top 3 improvements
- Location:
  - Returned directly to the user in the response
- Success criteria:
  - User receives clear fail/pass decision with concrete fixes

## Workflow
1. Read the target agent folder and the standards source (`/agents/agent-making-agent/README.md`).
2. Verify required files exist: `README.md`, `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md`, and `EXAMPLES.md`.
3. Check hard gates first (timestamp present and rubric output requirements).
4. Validate `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md` has `Blank Template` and `Filled Example`.
5. Validate blank template quality:
   - fields are relevant for this agent
   - template is append-only (no replacement required)
   - paths are portable (not machine-specific absolute paths)
6. Validate README `Skills` section quality:
   - includes `Required Skills` and `Potentially Required Skills`
   - includes `If Missing, Install From` with `/skills/...` and `$CODEX_HOME/skills/...`
   - includes `Fallback Behavior If Skill Is Unavailable`
   - includes explicit restart note after skill installation
7. If the agent depends on MCP-enabled tools, validate README `MCP` section quality:
   - includes `Required MCP Servers` and `Potentially Required MCP Servers`
   - includes `If Missing, Setup From` with `/mcp/...` references
   - includes `Fallback Behavior If MCP Is Unavailable`
   - includes explicit restart note after MCP setup/config changes
8. Validate `EXAMPLES.md` quality:
   - includes at least two diverse input/output examples
   - includes explicit guidance telling users to adapt examples to their own needs
9. Evaluate each rubric criterion (0-2) with evidence.
10. Compute total score and determine pass/fail threshold.
11. Return findings and top improvements.

## Constraints
- Do not give a pass if any hard gate fails.
- Do not give a pass if any required file is missing.
- Do not hide rubric results; they must be shown to user.
- Do not invent evidence; tie each finding to actual file content.
- Do not approve usage templates that require deleting placeholder text.
- Do not approve agents missing diverse examples with user adaptation guidance.
- Do not approve agents missing required skill metadata and fallback behavior.
- Do not approve MCP-dependent agents missing MCP setup/fallback metadata.

## Validation
- Confirm the agent folder contains:
  - `README.md`
  - `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md`
  - `EXAMPLES.md`
- Confirm all mandatory sections exist:
  - Mission
  - In Scope
  - Out of Scope
  - Inputs
  - Skills
  - Outputs
  - Workflow
  - Constraints
  - Validation
  - Failure Handling
  - Definition of Done
- Confirm `Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ` is near top.
- Confirm `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md` includes both:
  - `Blank Template`
  - `Filled Example`
- Confirm `Skills` section includes:
  - `Required Skills`
  - `Potentially Required Skills`
  - `If Missing, Install From`
  - `Fallback Behavior If Skill Is Unavailable`
  - `Restart Note`
- Confirm `If Missing, Install From` includes both repo `/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and runtime `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` guidance.
- Confirm restart note explicitly tells users to restart Codex after installing skills.
- For MCP-dependent agents, confirm README includes `MCP` section with:
  - `Required MCP Servers`
  - `Potentially Required MCP Servers`
  - `If Missing, Setup From`
  - `Fallback Behavior If MCP Is Unavailable`
  - `Restart Note`
- For MCP-dependent agents, confirm setup guidance references repo-local `/mcp/` docs/templates.
- For MCP-dependent agents, confirm restart note explicitly tells users to restart Codex after MCP setup/config changes.
- Confirm blank template includes only relevant fields for that agent.
- Confirm blank template is append-only and does not require replacing/deleting text.
- Confirm template paths are portable and not machine-specific absolute paths.
- Confirm `EXAMPLES.md` has at least two diverse examples.
- Confirm each example includes input and expected output.
- Confirm `EXAMPLES.md` instructs users to review and adapt examples to their context.
- Confirm rubric breakdown and total are shown in output.

## Failure Handling
- If target folder is missing:
  - Signal: target folder path does not exist
  - Action: stop and request correct folder path
- If required files are missing:
  - Signal: `README.md`, `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md`, or `EXAMPLES.md` absent
  - Action: return `FAIL` with missing file list
- If blank template is not append-only:
  - Signal: user must replace/delete placeholder content to run it
  - Action: return `FAIL` and request append-only template rewrite
- If template paths are not portable:
  - Signal: machine-specific absolute paths are hardcoded
  - Action: return `FAIL` and request repo-relative path format
- If examples are missing or weak:
  - Signal: no `EXAMPLES.md`, fewer than two examples, weak diversity, or missing adaptation guidance
  - Action: return `FAIL` and request complete examples file
- If skills metadata is missing or weak:
  - Signal: no `Skills` section, missing required skill subsections, missing install guidance, or missing restart note
  - Action: return `FAIL` and request a complete skills section
- If MCP metadata is missing or weak for an MCP-dependent agent:
  - Signal: no `MCP` section, missing required MCP subsections, missing setup guidance, or missing restart note
  - Action: return `FAIL` and request a complete MCP section
- If standards are ambiguous:
  - Signal: conflicting instructions
  - Action: use stricter requirement from `/agents/agent-making-agent/README.md` and call out assumption
- If hard gates fail:
  - Signal: missing timestamp, hidden rubric, or missing template sections
  - Action: return `FAIL` regardless of numeric score

## Definition of Done
- Review includes evidence-backed findings
- Rubric scores are shown criterion-by-criterion
- Total score and pass/fail are explicit
- Top 3 improvements are specific and actionable

Usage examples live in `USAGE_TEMPLATE.md` in this folder.
Scenario examples live in `EXAMPLES.md` in this folder.
