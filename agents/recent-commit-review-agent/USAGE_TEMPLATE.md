Inputs: local_events_path: /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/events.jsonl
Primary deliverable: /reports/issues/<task_identifier>/COMMIT_REVIEW_TASKS.md
Constraints:
- Exactly one selector in Review window: use `commits=8` OR `since=2026-02-01`.
- Read-only review. Do not modify source code.
- Resolve `tracking_mode` first and consume latest `REVIEW_TASK` packet.
- Do not write shared sprint state files; in local mode write only under `/reports/issues/<task_identifier>/`.
Output: Executive summary, top urgent items, findings sorted P0-P3, duplicate-merge notes, and verification steps per finding. Require unique finding IDs and require summary mentions to reference finding IDs. Publish structured review outcome event.
```
