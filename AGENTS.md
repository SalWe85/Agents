Ignore `guides/` and its subfolders unless the user explicitly asks to read or edit files there.

Never create a new Git worktree without explicit user permission. If branch switch is blocked by local tracked changes and a safe checkpoint commit resolves it, commit with a clear message and continue; otherwise stop and ask the user.
