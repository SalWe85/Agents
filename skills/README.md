## Install To Codex Runtime
For a missing skill `<skill-name>`, copy its folder into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (usually `~/.codex/skills/`):

```bash
mkdir -p "$CODEX_HOME/skills"
cp -R <repo-root>/skills/<skill-name> "$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>"
```

For curated OpenAI skills, you can also use `skill-installer`.

After any skill install, restart Codex so the skill is available in new runs.
