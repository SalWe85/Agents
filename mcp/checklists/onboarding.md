# MCP Onboarding Checklist

- [ ] Choose required MCP servers for this project (for example: Figma, Linear, Context7).
- [ ] Add server entries to local MCP config using `templates/mcp-config.example.toml` as guide.
- [ ] Configure credentials via environment variables or local private config (no secrets in repo).
- [ ] Restart Codex.
- [ ] Run validation checks for each configured server.
- [ ] Record which agents require which MCP servers.
- [ ] Define fallback behavior when MCP is unavailable.
